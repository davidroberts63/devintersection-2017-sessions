This session will show you how to find the low hanging fruit in your environment, explain why the problem exists, and step through how you can make the necessary changes to boost your SQL Server’s performance with a minimal amount of effort.  Jonathan will show you how to find common schema and code design problems that help you get the most bang for your buck when performance tuning SQL Server. By focusing on real-world examples with reproducible workloads, you will easily be able to see the impact of common problems and learn how to fix them quickly for improved performance from the least amount of effort.",
